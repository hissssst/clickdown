.SH SUGGESTED FLOW
If you're coming from traditional extremely overloaded project management software
(like Jira or Clickup), it might be a little confusing how everything related to
ticket management was already there. Please refer to the following recepies.

.B Create a project
.PP
Create a new empty directory, enter it and run \fIclickdown init\fR.
It will create Git repository, ticket template file and this README.
Then you'll need to configure git by editing \fI.git/config\fR to put
the project files on some git hosting (like Github, Gitlab or sr.ht).

.B Use existing project
.PP
Just use \fIgit clone\fR with a URL of the project you want to use

.B Create a ticket
.PP
Just run a \fIclickdown new Ticket\fR and it will create an empty ticket with
a name Ticket and some ither fields. Each field is populated by a simple shell command.

.B Edit a ticket
.PP
Just call \fIclickdown edit Ticket\fR and it will edit a ticket and push
it with relevant commit message

.B Edit a ticket template
.PP
Ticket template is just a shell template which allows regular shell commands
to be executed inside of the \fI\$()\fR. To edit it, call \fIclickdown edit-template\fR

.B Create a sprint or workflow or ticket group.
.PP
Simply create a directory like \fImkdir Sprint-1\fR. To put some tickets there, use symbolic links,
like \fIln -s ticket/Learn_Clickdown.txt Sprint-1\fR. To document what this sprint is about, just
put a file called \fIREADME.md\fR in the directory.

Don't forget to commit and push the change with \fIgit add . && git commit -m "Added Sprint-1" && git push\fR

.B Search tickets
.PP
To search by any field, use a powerful utility called \fIgrep\fR. For example, to search by author use
\`grep "Author: Jhon Doe" tickets/*\`. To search tickets by status (if you have this field), use
\`grep "Status: OPEN" tickets/*\`. To search in specific sprint or workflow or ticket group, use
\`grep "Author: Jhon Doe" Sprint-1/*\`

.B View history
.PP
For history and synchronization, clickdown uses powerful \fIgit\fR utility. To view history of changes
for specific ticket, use \fIgit blame tickets/Ticket.txt\fR. To view history of all changes
in the project, use \fIgit log\fR

.B Web user interface
.PP
Sometimes you don't have access to CLI. In this case, feel free to use powerful and extremely
efficient interfaces or your Git hosting
